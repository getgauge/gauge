## Gauge Core v/s Plugins

Gauge Core is a project that has features that would reflect across all Gauge use cases. These features are typically agnostic of the user's choice of implementation language. 

Plugins are meant to do something specific. These could be adding support for a new language, or have a new report etc. 

So, depending on where you see your contribution fit, please focus on the respective repository.
