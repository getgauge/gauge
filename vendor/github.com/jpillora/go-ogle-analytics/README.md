## Go-ogle Analytics

Track and monitor your Go programs for free with Google Analytics

The `ga` package is essentially a Go wrapper around the [Google Analytics - Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/reference)

**Warning** This package is 95% generated from the [Parameter Reference](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters) so it may contain bugs - please report them. GA allows "10 million hits per month per property" and will reject requests after that.

### Install

```
go get -v github.com/jpillora/go-ogle-analytics
```

### API

Create a new `client` and `Send()` a 'pageview', 'screenview', 'event', 'transaction', 'item', 'social', 'exception' or 'timing' event.

### Quick Usage

1. Log into GA and create a new property and note its Tracker ID

1. Create a `ga-test.go` file

	``` go
	package main

	import "github.com/jpillora/go-ogle-analytics"

	func main() {
		client, err := ga.NewClient("UA-XXXXXXXX-Y")
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}

		err = client.Send(ga.NewEvent("Foo", "Bar").Label("Bazz"))
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}

		println("Event fired!")
	}
	```

1. In GA, go to Real-time > Events

1. Run `ga-test.go`

	```
	$ go run ga-test.go
	Event fired!
	```

1. Watch as your event appears
