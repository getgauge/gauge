### Gauge Core v/s Plugins

Gauge Core is a project that has features that would reflect across all Gauge use cases. These features are typically agnostic of the user's choice of implementation language.

Plugins are meant to do something specific. These could be adding support for a new language, or have a new report etc. So, depending on where you see your contribution fit, please focus on the respective repository.

If your contribution is a code contribution and you do send us a pull request, you will first need to read and sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://gauge-bot.herokuapp.com/cla/).

### Developer documentation

If you are trying to write plugins for Gauge or trying to contribute to Gauge core, take a look at the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge/wiki/Gauge-Technical-Documentation).
