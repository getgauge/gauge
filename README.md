Gauge is a light weight cross-platform test automation tool. It provides the ability to author test cases in the business language.

Gauge champions the idea of **living/executable documentation**.

## Why Gauge?

The communication breakdowns between Developers and Business Stakeholders is a common risk of software development.

Gauge is an advanced automation tool that allows requirements to be written in a way that will be understood by all roles in a project and help bridge the gap.

Some of its key features include:

* A rich markup based on [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
* Simple, Flexible and Rich Syntax
* Business Language Tests : Supports the concept of executable documentation
* Consistent Cross Platform/Language Support for writing test code. Currently [supported languages](http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/test_code/index.html).
* Open Source, so it could be shared freely and improved by others as well
* A modular architecture with [plugin](http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/plugins/index.html) support.
* Extensible through [plugins](http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/plugins/index.html) and Hackable
* Supports External Data Sources
* Helps you create Maintainable and Understandable test suites
* [IDE Support](http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/ide_support/index.html)
