Gauge is a light weight cross-platform test automation tool. It provides the ability to author test cases in the business language.

Gauge champions the idea of **living/executable documentation**.

## Why Gauge?

The communication breakdowns between Developers and Business Stakeholders is a common risk of software development.

[BDD](http://agilecoach.typepad.com/agile-coaching/2012/03/bdd-in-a-nutshell.html) tools allow business analysts to write down behavioral requirements in a way that will also be understood by developers and help bridge the gap. Certain features of Gauge make it stand unique amongst others.

Some of its key features include:

* A rich markup based on [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
* Simple, Flexible and Rich Syntax
* Business Language Tests : Supports the concept of executable documentation
* Consistent Cross Platform/Language Support for writing test code. Currently [supported languages]((test_code/README.md).
* Open Source, so it could be shared freely and improved by others as well
* A modular architecture with [plugin](plugins/README.md) support.
* Extensible through [plugins](plugins/README.md) and Hackable
* Supports External Data Sources
* Helps you create Maintainable and Understandable test suites
* [IDE Support](ide_support/README.md)
